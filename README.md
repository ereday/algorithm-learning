Reimplementation of Learning Simple Algorithms From Examples paper on Julia

# TODO
- Revisit grid tasks data generation
- Make supervised grid tasks working
- ~~GRU controller~~
- ~~Model save~~
- ~~Visualization/demo~~ (Have some harmless bugs. Still wip) 
- Q-learning (work in progress)

# Q-Learning
- implement make_batches function
- implement loss/train function
- debug run_episodes! and other things
